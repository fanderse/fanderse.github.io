Hi, my name is Florian Andersen and I am a PhD student and researcher at Sciences Po, Paris. I study work and labor markets. Generally, I like economic sociology and data analysis. Specifically, I research French and German economies to understand how and why people switch jobs, occupations, and employers and to explain how this affects national markets and social inequality.

This blog is an opportunity for my writing practice, an outlet for presenting ideas that are not quite publication ready (or never will be), and for sharing code and tools.

My Story:  
After finishing my M.A. Sociology with distinction, I went on a four year sabbatical from academic life. I worked as a Business Analyst, Marketing Assistant, Co-Working Space Manager, and, since I love the outdoors and nature, founded my own gardening business. I worked part-time, full-time, was self-employed, and a freelancer - I experienced "the labor market" from inside and outside. Oh, and I am also a certified meditation teacher. Now I gather all my real-world experiences and take them back to academia to become a certified expert on all things work, careers, and labor market. After all, researching, writing, and analyzing data are the most enjoyable tasks I have found so far. Tell me if you know something more interesting! 

Reach out:  
I am excited to connect with academics and professionals from any field. Would you like to chat about your work? About how your company can attract and retain skilled personnel? Share your experiences with erratically moving between jobs and industries? About how to leave or re-enter academia? 
I am looking forward to hearing from you!
