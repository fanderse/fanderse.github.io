Now:
Publishing on careers, labor markets, and on how each of us can have a more meaningful work life as a PhD student and researcher at Sciences Po. Researching French and German economies to understand how and why people switch jobs, occupations, and employers. Explaining how this affects individual biographies, national markets, and social inequality.

Earlier:
After finishing my M.A. Sociology with distinction, I went on a four year sabbatical from academic life. I worked as a Business Analyst, Marketing Assistant, Co-Working Space Manager, and, since I love the outdoors and nature, founded my own gardening business. I worked part-time, full-time, was self-employed, and a freelancer - I experienced "the labor market" from inside and outside. Oh, and I am also a certified meditation teacher. Now I gather all my real-world experiences and take them back to academia to become a certified expert on all things work, careers, and labor market.

Reach out:
I am excited to connect with academics and professionals from any field. Would you like to chat about your work? About how your company can attract and retain skilled personnel? Share your experiences with erratically moving between jobs and industries? About how to leave or re-enter academia? 
I am looking forward to hearing from you!
