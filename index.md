Hi, my name is Florian Andersen and I am a PhD student and researcher at Sciences Po, Paris. 

I study work and labor markets. Specifically, I research French and German economies to understand how and why people switch jobs, occupations, and employers and to explain how this affects national markets and social inequality.

I have extensive experience working with linked employer-employee administrative data (SIEED, LIAB), survey data (EU-SILC), and digital human trace data produced by companies (Linkedin) and other organizations. I position my approach to data analysis between large-scale quantitative analysis and in-depth qualitative investigation, and I have worked with complex statistical models for cross-sectional and longitudinal data with various levels of nesting, qualitative and quantitative text analysis, visual and statistical network analysis, historical process tracing and causal modeling.

I love to dive into the complexity of social systems and to solve tough problems.

### My Story  
After finishing my M.A. Sociology with distinction, I went on a four year sabbatical from academic life. I worked as a business analyst, marketing assistant, co-working space manager, and, since I love the outdoors and nature, founded my own gardening business. I worked part-time, full-time, was self-employed, and a freelancer - I experienced "the labor market" from inside and outside. Oh, and I am also a certified meditation teacher. Now I gather all my real-world experiences and take them back to academia to become an expert on all things work, careers, and labor market. 

After all, researching, writing, and analyzing data are the most enjoyable tasks I have found so far. Tell me if you know something more interesting!
