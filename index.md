Hi, my name is Florian Andersen and I am a PhD student and researcher at Sciences Po, Paris. 

I study work and labor markets. Specifically, I research French and German economies to understand how and why people switch jobs, occupations, and employers and to explain how this affects national markets and social inequality.

I have extensive experience working with linked employer-employee administrative data, survey data, and otehr digital human trace data. I position my approach to data analysis between large-scale quantitative analysis and in-depth qualitative investigation, and I have worked with complex statistical models for cross-sectional and longitudinal data with various levels of nesting, qualitative and quantitative text analysis, visual and statistical network analysis, historical process tracing and causal modeling.

I love to dive into the complexity of social systems and to solve tough problems.

### My Story  
After finishing my M.A. Sociology with distinction in 2020, I went on a four year sabbatical from academic life. I worked as a business analyst, marketing assistant, co-working space manager, and, since I love the outdoors and nature, founded my own gardening business. I worked part-time, full-time, was self-employed, and a freelancer - I experienced "the labor market" from inside and outside. Oh, and I am also a certified meditation teacher. Now I gather all my real-world experiences and take them back to academia to research all things work, careers, and labor markets. 

After all, researching, writing, and analyzing data are the most enjoyable tasks I have found so far. Tell me if you know something more interesting!
